## Introduction

The E-Study Platform aims to address the challenges faced by second-year computer engineering students in accessing well-organized study materials during exam preparation. It consolidates resources such as PDFs, PPTs, and video lectures, providing a centralized and efficient learning tool.
## Motivation

The primary motivation behind the E-Study Platform is to eliminate the inefficiencies students face when searching for study materials across multiple sources. By creating a single platform with all necessary resources, students can focus more on learning and less on searching.
## Problem Statement

Computer engineering students often struggle to find specialized and reliable study materials for their exams. The existing resources are scattered and not tailored to their specific needs, leading to wasted time and reduced confidence.
## Objectives

 • To provide a centralized platform for accessing study materials tailored for computer engineering exams.

 • To ensure the platform is user-friendly and accessible across various devices.
 
 • To regularly update the content to maintain relevance and accuracy.
## Literature Survey

A thorough literature survey was conducted to gather insights from existing research and related works in the field of online study platforms and exam preparation tools. The survey informed the design and features of the E-Study Platform.
